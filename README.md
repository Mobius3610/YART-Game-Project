# YART-Game-Project

### Description: 

A basic roguelike that runs in the terminal and written in Python3. This game is based on the Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial series found on r/roguelikedev. 

## Link to tutorial: rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2

### What I hope to accomplish: 
I hope to write a fairly competent game and learn from this tutorial on how to write a roguelike game. Despite not having 'graphics' or 'physics', the classic roguelike should prove to be a decent challenge to write since there are a bunch of items that need to work in tandem with the world and combat system. 

### Libraries used:

- tcod
- numPY
- sys
- random
- color
- colorama
